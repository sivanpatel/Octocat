Git clone allows you to make a local copy of a remote repository. 
It copies all of the files and folders as well as all of the history of the files so that you can have a complete record of what has been changed.
It will put it all into a working directory with the name the same as the repository name.

Making a clone of a repsitory allows you to modify it in whatever way you like without affecting the original copy; changes that you make can then be suggested to the owner of the original repository.
